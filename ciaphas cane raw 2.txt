yes thank you . i croaked after a moment . whenever you dont have a clue whats
going on ive always found it never hurts to be polite . 
that is gratifying the thing said and threw the heretic in its left hand casually away . 
the others were standing around aimlessly now like sulky schola students when the
tutor turns up to spoil the fun . then it extended the same thin scaly hand equipped
with dagger-like claws towards me . after a heartstopping moment i divined its
intention and accepted the proffered assistance in gaining my feet . as i did so it
turned to the sullen group of heretics . 
this does not advance the greater good it said . disperse now and avoid conflict . 
well that was a challenge if ever id heard one . but to my surprise and i must admit
my intense relief the little knot of troublemakers slunk away into the shadows . i eyed
my rescuer a little apprehensively . he (or she - with kroot its impossible to tell and
only another kroot would care anyway) was slightly taller than i was and still looked
pretty intimidating . theyre tough enough to take on an ork in hand-to-hand combat
and i for one wouldnt be betting on the greenskin but if it wanted me dead it would
only have had to wait a few moments . i retrieved my fallen laspistol anyway and tried
to get my breath back . 
im obliged to you i said . i must admit i dont understand but im grateful i
fumbled the weapon back into its holster with some difficulty . my arm was swelling up
now and my fingers felt thick and unresponsive . my rescuer made a curious clicking
sound which i assumed to be its equivalent of laughter . 
imperial officers murdered by tau supporters . not a desirable outcome when the
political situation is tense . 
not a desirable outcome at any time when one of them is me i said and the xeno
made the clicking noise again . that reminded me of divas and i staggered across to
check on him . he was still breathing but unconscious a deep gash across his
forehead . id picked up enough battlefield medicine to know hed recover soon
enough but have the emperors own headache when he woke and that was fine with
me - serve the idiot right for nearly getting me killed . 
i have the honour to be gorok of the clan tcha the creature said . i am kroot . 
i know what you are i said . kroot killed my parents . and thereby got me dumped in
the schola progenium and thence into the commissariat instead of following my
undoubted true destiny of running some discreet little house of ill repute for slumming
spirers and guilders up from the sump with more money than sense to splash around . i
vaguely resented that far more than the loss of my progenitors who hadnt been all
that much to have around while they were alive to be honest . but it never hurts to
grab the moral high ground . my new acquaintance didnt seem terribly concerned
though . 
i trust they fought well he said . i doubted it . theyd only joined the guard to get out
of the hive ahead of the arbites and would certainly have deserted the first chance
they got so there must be something in genetics after all . 
not well enough i said and gorok clicked his amusement again . it was a slightly 
unnerving experience feeling that something so unhuman was able to read me more
readily than my own people . 
go carefully commissar he said . and feed on your enemies . may we have no cause
for conflict . 
well thank the emperor for that . but somehow i doubted that it was going to happen
and of course i was right . i was surprised though by how quickly the crisis came
upon us . 
sandy mitchell ´for the emperorª
editorial note
it is perhaps worth pointing out at this juncture that the account of his background that
cain gives during his conversation with the kroot although superficially plausible doesnt
quite hold together on further elimination . for one thing admittance to the schola
progenium is a privilege usually reserved for the offspring of officers . if he was indeed the
son of common troopers his parents must have acquitted themselves with singular valour in
the action which resulted in their demise which to say the least seems remarkably at odds
with his characterisation of them . moreover he implies that they enlisted and served
together . although mixed units are as pointed out elsewhere not unheard of in the imperial
guard it would have been extremely unusual for this to have been the case . 
cain makes frequent references throughout the archive to having spent his early years on
a hive world but never specifies which one which in turn makes the verification of any
such claims virtually impossible . however no hive world of which im aware raised a
mixed guard regiment in the timeframe consistent with his narrative . 
we should also bear in mind that by his own admission the man was a pathological liar
given to saving anything he judged would be effective in manipulating his listeners . 
four its often remarked that diplomacy is just warfare by other means . our battles are no
less desperate for being bloodless but at least we get wine and finger food . 
- tollen ferlang imperial envoy to the realm of ultramar 564-603 m41 . 
are you sure youre fit enough . kasteen asked a faint frown of concern appearing
between her eyebrows . i nodded and adjusted the sling id adopted for dramatic
effect . it was black silk matching the ebony hues of my dress uniform and made me
look tolerably dashing i thought . 
im fine i said smiling bravely . the other fellows got the worst of it thank the
emperor . in the day or two since the brawl with the heretics my arm had more or less
healed the medicae assuring me that id suffered nothing worse than severe bruising . 
it was still stiff and ached a little but all in all i thought id come off lightly . far
better than divas had anyway . hed spent the night in the infirmary and still walked
with a stick . for all that though he was as irritatingly cheerful as ever and id been
finding as many duties as i could to keep me out of the way whenever he suggested
socialising again . 
luckily for me hed lost consciousness before the kroot turned up so my reputation
had received another unmerited embellishment . he assumed id seen off our assailants
single-handed and i saw no good reason to disabuse him . besides the conversation
id had with the creature had been curiously unsettling and i found myself reluctant to
think about it too hard . i noticed divass account had tactfully glossed over the reason
why we were in the thick of the tau sympathizers heartland so maybe theyd finally
knocked a little common sense into him . knowing divas though i doubted it . 
well thats what they get for picking on the imperiums finest kasteen said eager to
buy the generally accepted version of events as the latest evidence of my exceptional
martial abilities reflected well on the regiment she led . she adjusted her own dress
uniform tugging the ochre greatcoat into place with every sign of discomfort . like
most valhallans she had an iceworlders tolerance for cold and found even the
mildest of temperate climates a little uncomfortable . having spent most of my service
with valhallan regiments id long become inured to their habit of air conditioning
their quarters to temperatures which left the breath smoking and tended to wear my
commissarial greatcoat at all times but they were still adjusting to the local conditions
here with some difficulty . 
if i might suggest colonel . i said tropical order would be perfectly acceptable . 
would it . she hovered indecisively reminding me again how young she was to be in
such an elevated position and i felt an unaccustomed pang of sympathy . the prestige
of the regiment was in her hands and it was easy to forget how heavily the
responsibility weighed on her . 
it would i assured her . she discarded the heavy fur cap disordering her hair and began to unfasten the coat . then she hesitated . 
i dont know she said . if they think im too informal itll reflect badly on all of us . 
for the emperors sake regina broklaw said his voice amused . what sort of
impression do you think youll make if youre sweating like an ork all evening . i
noted his use of her given name the first time id heard him do so with quiet
satisfaction . another milestone on the 597ths march towards full integration . the real
test would come with their first taste of combat of course and all too soon at that but
it was a good omen . the commissars right
the commissars always right i said smiling . it says so in the regulations . 
well i cant argue with that . kasteen pulled off the coat with evident relief and
smoothed the jacket beneath it . it was severely cut emphasising her figure in ways that
i was sure would attract the attention of most of the men in the room . broklaw nodded
approvingly . 
i dont think you need to worry about making an impression he said proffering a
comb . 
so long as its a good one . she smoothed her hair into place and began buckling her
weapon belt . like mine it held a chainsword but hers was ornately gilded and worked
with devotional scenes that decorated scabbard and hilt alike . the contrast with my
own functional model chipped and battered with far too much use for my liking was
striking . the holster at her other hip was immaculate too the glossy black leather
holding a bolt pistol which also gleamed from every highly polished surface and
which was intricately engraved with icons of the saints . 
no doubt about that i assured her . 
her nervousness was quite understandable as wed been invited to a diplomatic
reception at the governors palace . at least i had and in the interests of protocol the
colonel of my regiment and an appropriate honour guard would also be expected . this
sort of soiree was quite beyond her experience and she was all too acutely aware that
she was out of her depth . i on the other hand was well within mine . one of the many
benefits of being a hero of the imperium is that youre regarded as a prime catch by a
certain type of society hostess which meant that id had plenty of opportunity to enjoy
the homes wine cellars and daughters of the idle rich over the years and had
developed an easy familiarity with the world in which they moved . the main thing to
remember as i confided to kasteen was that they had their own idea of what soldiers
were like which had very little to do with the reality . 
the best thing you can do i said is not to get sucked in to all that protocol nonsense
in the first place . theyll expect us to get it wrong anyway so to the warp with them . 
she smiled in spite of herself and settled a little more comfortably into the upholstery
of the staff car jurgen had found somewhere . armed with my commissarial authority
which let him requisition practically anything short of a battleship without argument
hed developed quite a talent for acquiring anything i considered necessary for my
comfort or convenience over the years . i never asked too many questions about where
theyd come from as i suspected some of the answers might have complicated my life . 
thats easy for you to say she said . youre a hero . im justó
one of the youngest regimental commanders in the entire guard i said . a position
that in my opinion you hold entirely on merit i smiled . and my confidence is not
lightly earned it was what she needed to hear of course ive always been good at
manipulating people . thats one of the reasons im so good at my job . she began to
look a little happier . 
so what do you suggest . she said . 
i shrugged . they might be rich and powerful but theyre only civilians . however hard
they try to hide it theyll be in awe of you . ive always found it best at these things just
to be a plain simple military man with no interest in politics . the emperor points
and we obey . 
through the warp and far away . she finished the old song line with a smile . so we
shouldnt offer any opinions or answer questions about policy . 
exactly i said . if they want to talk tell them a few stories about your old campaigns . 
thats all theyre interested in anyway . that was certainly true in my case . i was sure
id only been invited as patriotic window-dressing to impress the tau with the calibre
of the opposition theyd be facing if they were foolish enough to try and make a fight
of it with us . of course in my case that meant they could pretty much run their flag
up the pole of the governors palace any time they felt like it but that was beside the
point . 
thank you ciaphas . kasteen put her chin on her hand and watched the street lights
flicker past outside the window . that was the first time anyone in the regiment had
addressed me in personal terms since i joined it . it felt strange but curiously pleasant . 
youre welcomeö regina i said and she smiled . (i know what youre thinking and
youre wrong . i did come to think of her as a friend in the end and broklaw too but
thats as far as it went . anything else would have made both our positions untenable . 
sometimes looking back i think thats a shame but there it is . )
the governors palace was in what the locals called the old quarter where the fad
for tau-influenced architecture which had infected the rest of the city had failed to take
hold so the vague sense of unease which had oppressed me since we arrived began to
lift at last . the villas and mansions slipping past outside the car had taken on the
familiar blocky contours of the imperial architecture with which id been familiar all
my life and i felt my spirits begin to rise to the point where i almost began to
anticipate enjoying the evening ahead of us . 
jurgen swung the vehicle through an elaborate pair of wrought-iron gates decorated
with the imperial aquila and our tyres hissed over raked gravel as we progressed
down a long curving drive lit by flickering flambeaux . behind us the truck with our
honour guard followed no doubt making a terrible mess of things with its heavy duty
tyres the soldiers making the most of the grandstand view afforded by its open rear
decking to point and chatter at the sights . beyond the flickering firelight we could
make out a rolling landscaped lawn dotted with shrubs and ornamental fountains -
automatically some part of my mind was assessing the best way of using them for 
cover . 
an audible gasp from kasteen signalled that the palace itself had come into view from
her side window and a moment later the curve of the drive brought it into my field of
vision . 
not a bad little billet i said with elaborate casualness . kasteen composed herself
wiping the bumpkin gawp off her face . 
reminds me of a bordello we used to visit when i was an officer cadet she replied
determined to match my blase exterior . i grinned . 
good i said . remember were soldiers . were not impressed by this sort of thing . 
absolutely not she agreed straightening her jacket unnecessarily . 
there was a lot of the building not to be impressed by . it must have covered over a
kilometre from end to end although of course much of that area would be given over
to courtyards and interior gardens currently hidden behind the outer wall . buttresses
and crenellations protruded like acne from every surface encrusted with statuary
commemorating previous governors and other local notables no one could now
remember the names of and vast areas had been gilded reflecting the firelight from
outside in a manner which was to prove eerily prophetic had we but known . at the
time though it simply struck me as one of the most stridently vulgar piles of masonry
id ever encountered . jurgen pulled up outside the main entrance halting at the end of
a red carpet as skilfully as a shuttle pilot entering a docking port . after a moment the
truck pulled up behind us and our honour guard piled out deploying on either side of
it a full squad five pairs of troopers facing each other across the crimson weave
lasguns at the port . 
shall we . i extended an arm to kasteen as a flunkey dressed as a wedding cake
bustled up to open the door for us . 
thank you commissar . she took it as we emerged and i stopped for a moment to
have a word with jurgen . 
any further orders sir . 
i shook my head . just find somewhere to park and get yourself something to eat i
said . strictly speaking i could have had my aide accompany us but the thought of
jurgen mingling with the cream of the gravalaxian aristocracy was almost too hideous
to contemplate . i turned to the noncom in charge of the honour guard a sergeant
lustig and tapped the combead id slipped into my ear . you too i added . you might
as well be comfortable while you wait for us . ill contact you when were ready to
leave . 
yes sir . a faint smile tried to form on his broad face before discipline reasserted
itself and he inhaled . 
squadö attenö shun . he bellowed and they snapped to it with nanosecond
precision . no surprise that theyd won the extra drink ration this week i thought . the
crash of synchronised heels caused heads to turn all around us minor local nobles
looking mightily impressed and their chauffeurs even more so . 
i think weve made an impression kasteen murmured as we gained the elaborately
